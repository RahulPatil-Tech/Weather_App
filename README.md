# Weather_App
Code for Weather App in Python – GUI

<br><b>1. Install and Import Tkinter</br></b>
We begin with installing the required libraries using the pip package manager. Enter the below commands in your command line or terminal to install the modules.

<br><b>2. Initialize the Tkinter Window</br></b>
As a next step, we initialize our GUI window using the Tkinter module.

<br><b>3. OpenWeatherMap API</br></b>
In our code, we will be using Open Weather API (free tier) to get the current weather information which is accurate and latest.

1. To do so, go to OpenWeatherMap website and create an account.
2. After creating your account, go to profile and then “My API keys“.
3. This will open a webpage for your API Key, as shown below, copy it for later use in code in the next step.

<br><b>4. Weather Function</br></b>
Here, comes the part where we add functionality to our code. This part is the most crucial in getting correct weather information, as this involves fetching data from the API and displaying it in an accurate format.

<br><b>5. Coding the GUI (frontend elements)</br></b>
We now start to code the elements as per the GUI, for heading, text, labels, buttons, etc.

<br><b>Output</br></b>
